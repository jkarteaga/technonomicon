import Title from "../../components/Title.astro";

# {frontmatter.title}

**Start it up like any other Astro theme.**

```bash
  npm create astro@latest -- --template technomancy-dev/technonomicon
```

After that you can open up `pages/index.astro` where you will see we are using `collections` to get an `issue`. Issues are the basic building blocks of a technonomicon. They can be treated like pages in a textbook or issues of a newspaper, but we will get into that later. For now just open up the file for the issue and glance through it.
