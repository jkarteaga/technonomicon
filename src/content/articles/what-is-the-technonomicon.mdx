<FancyParagraph>
  Whether it be a curse, blog, tabloid, manga, if you want to write a lot of content and publish it on the web the technonomicon is the way to do it. Somewhere along the way we all agreed a blog should look one particular way.
  <span class="group/tooltip relative">This<span class="text-accent">\*</span><span class="w-min text-sm -top-6 group-hover/tooltip:visible text-top invisible align-top bg-accent text-accent-content p-2 rounded absolute tracking-[-1px]">(largely because of the popularity of wordpress)</span></span>
  caused all of the web to look a certain way.

## Portable Content like never before. 

These two cards use the same file for content. They simply have a different wrapper, which because of the power of MDX has total control of how the elements are rendered. 
<div class="flex gap-2 [perspective:900px]">
  <Card markdown={technonomicon} />
  <CardHolo markdown={technonomicon} />
</div>

The way we landed on kindof sucks. So I made something else.

[The technonomicon is a a made-up language written out in living glyphs lifted
from demonic literature and religious text](https://genius.com/9159582)

Ok, maybe that is a bit dramtic, but I do think it is pretty cool, and it was inspired by various forms of print media, and early ideas about how the internet should work.

Because of this is has a large focus on text, and how ideas connect to each other.
