<FancyParagraph>
Whether it be a course, blog, tabloid, manga, if you want to write a lot of content and publish it on the web the technonomicon is the way to do it. Somewhere along the way we all agreed a blog should look one particular way. 
<span class="group/tooltip relative">This<span class="text-accent">*</span><span class="w-max text-sm -top-6 group-hover/tooltip:visible text-top invisible align-top bg-accent text-accent-content p-2 rounded absolute tracking-[-1px]">(largely because of the popularity of wordpress)</span></span>
caused all of the web to look a certain way.

The way we landed on kindof sucks. So I made something else.

Ok, maybe that is a bit dramtic, but I do think it is pretty cool, and it was inspired by various forms of print media, and early ideas about how the internet should work.

Because of this is has a large focus on text, and how ideas connect to each other.

## There are some nifty built in tools for making content that grows organically. 

Like how this paragraph doesn't show in the issue, but does when you view the article itself. 

Articles can start as a few sentances on an issue. Then grow into something much larger. 

## Content can change and that is ok. 

Content often takes on many forms. Sometimes an idea takes on a life of it's own, and sometimes it needs to be carried by others. The technonomicon is flexible enough to let ideas grow, shrink and transform.
