    __Start it up like any other Astro theme.__

    ```javascript
    npm create astro@latest -- --template technomancy-dev/technonomicon
    ```

    After that you can open up `pages/index.astro` where you will see we are using `collections` to get an `issue`. Issues are the basic building blocks of a technonomicon. They can be treated like pages in a textbook or issues of a newspaper, but we will get into that later. For now just open up the file for the issue and glance through it. 
  </div>

  <Title class="col-span-12 order-3 text-4xl lg:text-6xl lg:col-span-4 text-justify" title={"So how the hell do I use this thing??"}/>

  <Title class="col-span-12 lg:col-span-8 order-5 text-4xl lg:text-6xl" title={"Issues are collections of things."}/>

  <div class="col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 order-6">
    You can think of them like issues of newspapers. You might get a small taste of some content that can lead you to turning the page to something else. That somewhere else can be on this site, or off it. If you have to fit it into a mental model for the web, thing about how blogs have tags, and a tag page might link to many articles.

  <SnippetLink target="_blank" href="https://www.lipsum.com/">
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
    the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
    through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
    very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
    comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
